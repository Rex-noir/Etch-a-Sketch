# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project written by Ace while following **The Odin Project**.

## How it works?

* Click and hold your mouse to start sketching.
* Double-clicking anywhere displays "Mousedown" in the log, indicating sketching is active.
* Sketching stops when you click inside the sketchpad or move your mouse outside.
* To exit the **Mousedown**, there are two ways to do.
    * 1. You can single click your mouse within the sketch pad. (or)
    * 2. You can move out your mouse pointer outside the sketch pad.
* "Mouse not down" displayed in the log means sketching is inactive.
